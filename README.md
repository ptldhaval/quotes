# quotes.json

Created the file as part of the exercise at FreeCodeCamp to create random quotes.
Below resources used to get the good quotes:
1. https://gist.github.com/signed0/d70780518341e1396e11
2. https://buddhapowerstore.com/blogs/buddhism/top-31-buddha-quotes-to-enlighten-your-mind-and-soul

You can add/modify the quote(s).  

Enjoy...
